# Project Storyboarding

## Initial Wireframes 

Based on the outline and sketches created in part 1, I attempted to storyboard the project using balsamiq. I made a few changes from my intial sketches based on the feedback I received during the group critque activity conducted in class. I added a quick fact about the racial disparities at the beginning to peek interest in the reader. Based on my fellow student's suggestion, I also tried to trim down the number of visualizations and data in the storyline. 

Before attempting to storyboard in balsamiq, I created a quick sketch shown below:

While creating the wireframes, I initially decided to embed the images of the visualizations in balsamiq. After experimenting with that I realized that it was cluttering the storyboard unecessarily and was not serving the intended purpose. I decided to instead use the balsamiq mockup text/graph to show the placement of the visualizations. Following is the image of the intial storyboard:
