# Project Storyboarding

## Initial Wireframes 

Based on the outline and sketches created in part 1, I attempted to storyboard the project using balsamiq. I made a few changes from my intial sketches based on the feedback I received during the group critque activity conducted in class. I added a quick fact about the racial disparities at the beginning to peek interest in the reader. Based on my fellow student's suggestion, I also tried to trim down the number of visualizations and data in the storyline. 
  
While creating the wireframes, I initially decided to embed the images of the visualizations in balsamiq. After experimenting with that I realized that it was cluttering the storyboard unecessarily and was not serving the intended purpose. I decided to instead use the balsamiq mockup text/graph to show the placement of the visualizations. Following is the image of the intial storyboard:

## User Research Protocol 
 
### Target Audience
When I developed the story for this topic, the audience I had in mind were those who worked in the healthcare sector (providers, insurers, policy makers) and who were in a position to effect changes at some level in the healthcare system. This could be administrators who can bring about change at the hospital level or insurance companies that can target certain populations or even policy makers who can revise policies to address this issue. 

### Audience Selection
Given the duration and scope of this project, I was unable to interview anyone representing my target audience. I decided to interview the following two individuals:
- **Consultant in the healthcare industry**: This individual cannot make any relevant changes as described in the call of action. However, I chose him because as a consultant he interacts with providers and insurers. He knows their behavior and knows what it takes to convince them. 
- **Heinz Healthcare Policy student**: This individual is currently studying healthcare policy here at Heinz College. Even if she can’t directly influence policy now, she has interned and will in future work with a state government. 

### Interview Protocol 
Before developing the questions, I listed different things I wanted to find out regarding my wireframes and visualizations:
- Does my story convey the message that I want it to? 
- Are my mockups and visualizations self-explanatory? 
- Do my mockups and visualizations get the user interested to find more details about the topic? - Do they care about this topic a bit more than they did earlier?

Following is the protocol that I used to interview the two individuals. For each question I also prepared how I will ask the question and what the purpose of that question would be.

- What are the 3 key things you remember from the storyline?
  - For this question, I will show the balsamiq storyboard to the interviewee for about 2 minutes and then take it away. I will then ask them about 3 key ideas or pieces of information that they remember from the storyboard. Usually, when people go through a webpage, they don’t spend a whole amount of time reading through. They glance at it for a minute or so before deciding whether they want to know more. Through this exercise, I want to know if they are able to pick out the most important ideas/ information easily. 
  
- What is the story about?
  - For this question, I will show them the storyboard again and add to it the visualizations associated with each mockup. This time, I will give them enough time to look through both the wireframes and the visualizations. Through this question, I want to find out if the storyline makes sense to them. I also want to check if they do realize the importance of the topic. 

- Are the visualizations self-explanatory? 
  - The purpose of this question is to check if I need to change the way I have visualized the data or if I need to add more text in support of the visualization. 
 
- Do you feel like there is too much data or too many charts? 
  - An important aspect of this topic is the emotional connect. Unfortunately, I cannot use a story to relate this point. The only way I can connect to the audience is through the horrifying statistics. But if the user feels that there is just too much data, I will have to change how I present it to the audience. 
 
 - Do you have any other suggestions to improve the story or any parts of it? 
  - If during the initial questions, they completely miss the storyline, I will at this point relate the story to them. I will then ask for suggestions to convey it in a better manner. If they did follow my storyline, I will ask them for general suggestions. 
  
### Highlights from the Interviews 

#### Consultant
3 key things that he remembered:
- 60% of deaths are preventable 
- There has been a rise in maternal mortality in the US
- High spending in the US but still have a higher maternal mortality 

His narration of the story brought out all the important points and he could follow the story with minimum details in the mockup. He was really shocked that the maternal mortality was on the rise in the United States. One interesting observation was that he was amazed at the fact that 60% of the deaths were preventable and kept bringing up that point multiple times. I wasn't sure if it was the placement of the statistic or actually the statistic that caught his attention. If I had the time, I would have tested placing the racial disparity statistic more prominently. 

Following were the suggestions he gave with regards to the visualizations:
- The text on the axes is cut off and hence is difficult to read
- The % GDP graph was a bit difficult to understand and relate to the high MMR. He asked why I couldn't show the total healthcare spending? 
- He also mentioned that it was difficult to find USA amongst the countries in the visualization

Another point he mentioned was if it was possible for me to show the change in racial disparities over the years. It would be intresting to find out if the increase in maternal mortality can also be tracked by an increase in racial disparities. 

#### Healthcare Policy Student
3 key things that she remembered:
- Black women have a higher morality rate
- Better monitoring and care coordination required 
- 60% of the deaths were preventable 

Since she was already familiar with the topic, she could easily follow the story. Although she was aware of the rise in maternal mortality, she did not connect it to racial and educational disparities. When she narrated the story back to me she focused more on the factors contributing to the maternal mortality rather than the general details about maternal mortality. I felt like that was expected since she was already knew the topic. 

Following were the suggestion she gave regarding the visualizations:
- The titles of the charts and titles of the slide are repetitive
- The axes labels are cut off 
- Could it be better if you added the label to each of the lines in the Comparing with Different Countries visualization?


### Changes to the Wireframes and Visualizations
Based on the feedback I received during the interviews, I revised the wireframes and the visualizations. 

Following are the revised wireframes:

I was unable to get Maternal Mortality data for different races for the past years. It would have definitely been an intersting comparison.
