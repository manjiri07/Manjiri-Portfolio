# Project Storyboarding

## Initial Wireframes 

Based on the outline and sketches created in part 1, I attempted to storyboard the project using balsamiq. I made a few changes from my intial sketches based on the feedback I received during the group critque activity conducted in class. I added a quick fact about the racial disparities at the beginning to peek interest in the reader. Based on my fellow student's suggestion, I also tried to trim down the number of visualizations and data in the storyline. 

Before attempting to storyboard in balsamiq, I created a quick sketch shown below:

While creating the wireframes, I initially decided to embed the images of the visualizations in balsamiq. After experimenting with that I realized that it was cluttering the storyboard unecessarily and was not serving the intended purpose. I decided to instead use the balsamiq mockup text/graph to show the placement of the visualizations. Following is the image of the intial storyboard:

 ## Initial Visulizations 
 
 
 ## User Research Protocol 
 
### Target Audience
When I developed the story for this topic, the audience I had in mind were those who worked in the healthcare sector (providers, insurers, policy makers) and who were in a position to effect changes at some level in the healthcare system. This could be administrators who can bring about change at the hospital level or insurance companies that can target certain populations or even policy makers who can revise policies to address this issue. 

### Audience Selection
Given the duration and scope of this project, I was unable to interview anyone representing my target audience. I decided to interview the following two individuals:
- **Consultant in the healthcare industry**: This individual cannot make any relevant changes as described in the call of action. However, I chose him because as a consultant he interacts with providers and insurers. He knows their behavior and knows what it takes to convince them. 
- **Heinz Healthcare Policy student**: This individual is currently studying healthcare policy here at Heinz College. Even if she can’t directly influence policy now, she has interned and will in future work with a state government. 

### Interview Protocol 
Before developing the questions, I listed different things I wanted to find out regarding my wireframes and visualizations:
- Does my story convey the message that I want it to? 
- Are my mockups and visualizations self-explanatory? 
- Do my mockups and visualizations get the user interested to find more details about the topic?

Following is the protocol that I used to interview the two individuals. For each question that I asked I have described how i asked it and what the purpose of it was.

- What are the 3 key things you remember from the storyline?
  - For this question, I showed the balsamiq storyboard to the interviewee for a minute and then asked 3 key ideas or pieces of information that they remember. Usually, when people go through a webpage, they don’t spend a whole amount of time reading through. They glance at it for a minute or so before deciding whether they want to know more. Through this exercise, I wanted to know if are able to pick out the most important ideas/ information easily. 
  
- What do you think the storyline is trying to tell?
  - For this question, I showed them the storyboard again and supplemented it with printed copies of the visulization associated with each mockup. This time, I gave them enough time to look through both the wireframes and the visualizations.
