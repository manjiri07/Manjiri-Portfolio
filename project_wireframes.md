# Project Storyboarding

## Initial Wireframes 

Based on the outline and sketches created in part 1, I attempted to storyboard the project using balsamiq. I made a few changes from my intial sketches based on the feedback I received during the group critque activity conducted in class. I added a quick fact about the racial disparities at the beginning to peek interest in the reader. Based on my fellow student's suggestion, I also tried to trim down the number of visualizations and data in the storyline. 

Before attempting to storyboard in balsamiq, I created a quick sketch shown below:

While creating the wireframes, I initially decided to embed the images of the visualizations in balsamiq. After experimenting with that I realized that it was cluttering the storyboard unecessarily and was not serving the intended purpose. I decided to instead use the balsamiq mockup text/graph to show the placement of the visualizations. Following is the image of the intial storyboard:

### Target Audience
When I developed the story for this topic, the audience I had in mind were those who worked in the healthcare sector (providers, insurers, policy makers) and who were in a position to effect changes at some level in the healthcare system. This could be administrators who can bring about change at the hospital level or insurance companies that can target certain populations or even policy makers who can revise policies to address this issue. 

### Interviewee Selection
Given the duration and scope of this project, I was unable to interview anyone representing my target audience. I decided to interview the following two individuals:
- Consultant in the healthcare industry: This individual cannot make any relevant changes as described in the call of action. However, I chose him because as a consultant he interacts with providers and insurers. He knows their behavior and knows what it takes to convince them. 
- Heinz Healthcare Policy student: This individual is currently studying healthcare policy here at Heinz College. Even if she canâ€™t directly influence policy now, she has interned and will in future work with a state government.
