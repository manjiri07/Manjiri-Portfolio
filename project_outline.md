## Rise in Maternal Mortality in the United States 

### High-level Summary 

Maternal mortality in the United States has been rising over the past few years. Black women and women in the lower income groups have had much higher death rates than other women. Racial bias, lack of access to quality care and poor monitoring of motherâ€™s health have all contributed to this rise in pregnancy-related deaths. 
We need better monitoring of risk factors for mothers and improved better care for mothers regardless of their race, education and income. 

### Structure of Project 

#### Maternal Mortality in the United States (Setup) 
- Rise in maternal mortality over the years 
- Define maternal mortality and show how it is calcuated
- Provide general statistics regarding pregnancy-related deaths (CDC vital signs report) 

#### Comparing rates to other developed countries 
- Compare United States maternal mortality rates (MMR) with other countries such as UK, Canada, Germany
- Point out the fact that MMR is high even though US spends the most on healthcare compared to other developed countries 

#### Deep dive into US maternal mortality 
- Show racial disparities ( black women are 3 to 4 times more likey to die as compared to white women)
- Low income and education also has an effect on maternal mortality 
- How does access of care relate to maternal mortality?
- What are some of the causes of pregnancy related deaths

#### Call to Action
- Better Monitoring
- Improved Coordination
