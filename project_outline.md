## Rise in Maternal Mortality in the United States 

### High-level Summary 

Maternal mortality in the United States has been rising over the past few years. Black women and women in the lower income groups have had much higher death rates than other women. Racial bias, lack of access to quality care and poor monitoring of motherâ€™s health have all contributed to this rise in pregnancy-related deaths. 
We need better monitoring of risk factors for mothers and improved better care for mothers regardless of their race, education and income. 

### Structure of Project 

#### Maternal Mortality in the United States (Setup) 
- Rise in maternal mortality over the years 
- Define maternal mortality and show how it is calcuated
- Provide general statistics regarding pregnancy-related deaths (CDC vital signs report) 

#### Comparing rates to other developed countries 
- Compare United States maternal mortality rates (MMR) with other countries such as UK, Canada, Germany
- Point out the fact that MMR is high even though US spends the most on healthcare compared to other developed countries 

#### Deep dive into US maternal mortality 
- Show racial disparities ( black women are 3 to 4 times more likey to die as compared to white women)
- Low income and education also has an effect on maternal mortality 
- How does access of care relate to maternal mortality?
- What are some of the causes of pregnancy related deaths
- Create a persona 

#### Call to Action
- Better Monitoring
  - Recognizing risk factors and social determinants of health early on 
- Improved Coordination 
  - Coordination between physicians, payors and other organizations to ensure better care for mothers

### Data Sources 
  
  - [CDC Vital Signs Report](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/maternal-deaths/)
    - CDC Vital Signs Report provides a summary of their maternal mortality data. The underlying data itself is not publicly available but the summary statistics are insightful.
  - [Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Maternal Mortality]( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6818e1.htm#T3_down)
    - Using this data, I want to show that the maternal mortality rates are much higher for black women and those who belong to low income groups.
  - [Maternal mortality trends in the US](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001799/)
    - The way maternal mortality rates are calculated in the United States is still not well defined as compared to other countries. Hence, I had to go through different articles and methods to make sure I capture the correct rates. This article talks about the methods they used to calculate the final rates. 
  - [Global maternal mortality rates](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31470-2/fulltext)
    - This article talks more about global maternal mortality rates in general. I will be using the MMR data for US and other developed countries shown in one of the tables in this article. 
  - [CDC Causes of Maternal Deaths](causes_of_pregnancy_related_death_in_the_united_states_2011_2016)
    - The CDC website had a section where it talked about the causes of deaths. I downloaded this csv file from their website. 
  - [OECD Healthcare Spending](OECD_healthcare_spending.csv)
    - OECD website hosts rich datasets on different aspects of OECD countries. I downloaded the healthcare spending data from their website. 
    
### Method and Medium

I will be using Shorthand as the medium for this project. Following is the way I plan to complete the project:
- Create a more refined story (storyboarding) using balsamiq
- Experiment different data visualizations using tableau to make sure I bring the reader's attention to the right details 
- Setup modules in shorthand that I can fill in later 
- For each module, refine what I want to talk about. Decide whether a visualization or a description or both would be required to get my point across to the reader
- Add in the content and visualizations 
- Add any other images if required to each module 
- Revise placement of content and visualization based on reader feedback 
- Finalize shorthand content
