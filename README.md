# About Me
My name is Manjiri. I am a 2nd year Healthcare Policy and Management Master's student at the Heinz College. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I am passionate about health equity and equal access to quality healthcare. I hope to leverage my skills as a biomedical engineer and a policy analyst to tackle problems in the field of healthcare innovation and health services delivery. 

# What I hope to learn
I have encountered many situations in the past where I was unable to convey the importance of an issue or a program using data to my audience. My frustration of "how do you not see what the data is showing you" made realize that the fault was mine and not theirs. I hope to learn different data visualization techniques to better convey the story the data is telling.
