## Final Data Story

### Intended Audience

The intended audience for my story are healthcare providers and policymakers. Only recently have we begun to realize that there exists a relation between health outcomes and other social determinants such as access, income, education. My aim was to bring this to attention to my audience.

Providers and policymakers have a huge influence on improving health outcomes. We focus so much on building the best hospitals with the latest technology that we sometimes forget that access, race and other social determinants play such a big role. Maternal mortality is one of the basic public health indicators and it is disturbing to see that we rank the worst amongst all the developed countries even when we spend the most on healthcare. 

My call to action is also specific to the audience. When babies are born, we focus on babies more (and rightly so). But we ignore the mother’s health in this process. There are some heart wrenching stories of mothers dying because of failure to detect a risk early on. Also, there is enough evidence that racial bias exists in our healthcare system. I wanted to point out it’s effect on something as basic as woman delivering a child. 

### Design Decisions

There were so many aspects of maternal mortality that I wanted to discuss that it took me a while to hone my story down. I think Part 1 and 2 really helped me focus on my main points and the storyline. I think I would have had a completely different presentation if I would have directly dived into making the final presentation. 

In part 1, sketching the graphs and creating a rough story was useful particularly because I could figure out where a visualization would be more powerful. Also, the concept of having a setup, conflict and solution helped me really focus on the important aspects of my story. The rough story creations also helped me find data sources early on. There were some parts where I couldn’t find data sources and at that point, I could easily substitute a visualization with text in my sketch. It was less nerve wracking to figure out lack of data sources for certain aspects early on than later in the project. 

In part 2, the most useful part was the storyboarding and user research. I wasn’t able to do an in-depth user research since my audience was a niche group. But I still valued the feedback since it made me understand what parts of the topic the users do or don’t understand. The storyboarding using balsamiq was beneficial because I changed the story multiple times before the final version. Just seeing all the pieces together visually made a huge difference. The final shorthand creation became easy because I just had to substitute the sketches in my wireframes with actual text and visualization without having to think about the framework. 

In part 3, apart from the visualization I had to also think about how images could be used to aid the story. They needed to be powerful but not distracting because I wanted my data visualizations to speak more. Also, I was extremely tempted to create complex visualizations but I realized that for the story i wanted to tell, simple bar charts and line graphs would suffice. I wanted the audience to easily figure out what's wrong with the state of maternal mortality in the United States just by looking at the visualizations.
